git checkout -b feature/description-of-your-feature
```

## Making Changes

- **Write your code.** Ensure your code is thoroughly tested and functions as expected. Clear, well-commented code is always appreciated.

- **Compile and test.** Before submitting a pull request, ensure your code compiles, passes lint checks, and all tests are successful. You should also write unit tests for your contributions. Use the following command for these checks:

```bash
make all
```

- **Commit your changes.** Adhere to the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard when writing commit messages.

## Submitting a Pull Request

- **Initiate a pull request (PR).** Go to the main `zkfoundry-smoke-test` repository. Your recently pushed branch should be highlighted, showing a "Compare & pull request" button. Click on it and provide a clear, detailed description of your changes in the PR.

- **Await a review.** Our maintainers will review your PR. They might request changes or clarifications, so be ready to address any feedback.

## Code Style Guide

We follow Rust's official coding style guidelines. Before committing, ensure your code is formatted and lint checks pass:

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check &&
cargo clippy -Zunstable-options -- -D warnings --allow clippy::unwrap_used
```

This ensures consistent code style throughout the project and helps identify potential issues early.
